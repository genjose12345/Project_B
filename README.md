# Project B: Inter-Process Communication with Pipes

### Project Overview
This project demonstrates inter-process communication using pipes in a Linux environment. 
The implementation displays how separate processes can communicate through standard UNIX pipes.

### Environment Setup
Windows and Mac users:
1) Download UTM in order to create a virtual Linux system
2) Next we will download the ISO Linux system ubuntu (make sure to get the right one as mac and windows hav a different ISO)
3) Next we will open utm seleect linux and upload the iso so that UTM can begin running our virtaul System
4) Once we are logged inside we can open firefox and download zed
5) Upon opening zed we will open to the desktop
6) we will  begin by running this command in the terminal: mkdir (folder name)
7) next we will move into the foldewer cd (folder name)
8) then we will run cargo init(this created all the neccary files in order to run our Rust project)
9) Lastly in the folder we must add a depency inside the Cargho.toml file  as shown here ```[dependencies]
chrono = "0.4"``` 
10) Next will download the file from github and past our .rs file inside thew src folder that is created
11) then we can now run our project inside our zed IDE by presseing the arrow next to the fn main
    
Linux Users:
Linux user can begin from step 4

### list of dependencies and installation
1) Linux OS
2) Zed IDE
3) UTM & Ubuntu(optional)
